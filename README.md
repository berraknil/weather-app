# A Weather Application

### Built using jQuery, Weather Underground and Unsplash

This is a weather application that fetches forecast from the Weather Underground API and uses IP based geolocation. 
It displays a random photo in the background from the Unsplash API depending on the screen resolution. If the screen resolution is less than 700px in width (i.e. less than a tablet on portrait view), it just displays a background gradient with a simple color fallback.
It is also possible to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit by using the jQuery toggle.
